# HappieStreamChallenge
Week of 2/27/2016: Create an RPG text adventure and post it to r/TheHappieMakers! Each week will be a new challenge.

Every week I will stream on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHappieCat) on Saturday at 12PM CST. Each stream will be focused on some topic followed by a small weekly challenge. You can fork the code on my Github here or make your own from scratch. Be sure to post your code on Github (don't zip an EXE!) and link it on the subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHappieMakers/). Let's make some cool stuff :D
