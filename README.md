# HappieStreamChallenge  
## Week of 2/27/2016: Create an RPG text adventure and post it to r/TheHappieMakers! Each week will be a new challenge.

Hi HappyCat! I have done this with my fair knowledge of javascript and python and I hope you like it!

Puppy training is your life. Your life goal is to befriend every puppy in the universe, from far and wide. It starts out easy, but there ARE some...edge cases...

So join the puppies in this game lacking any thrilling narrative, in this text adventure, in this UNIVERSE!!!

**NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY BE EDITED, ADDED, OR REMOVED FROM THE EXPERIENCE.**
